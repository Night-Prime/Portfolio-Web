Here, I will present one framework I have used many times to understand complex things that we have a lot of in software engineering.This technique is called The Feynman Technique. It is a powerful learning tool that helps you better understand complex topics. The method is named after Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who developed it to understand complex scientific theories. The idea behind the technique is simple: explain concepts in simple language as if you were explaining them to a child.\",\"published\":false,\"updatedAt\":\"2024-10-26T12:59:54.297Z\",\"createdAt\":\"2024-10-26T12:59:54.297Z\",\"deletedAt\":null}\u001b[39m","service":"dhaniel-service","timestamp":"2024-10-26T12:59:54.301Z"}
